# Graph Neural Network Model for Prediction of Subjective Features of Question-Answers

## Overview
This project presents a SAGEConv Graph Neural Network Model for Multivariate Regression designed for the Google Quest Q&A Challenge Dataset. The model focuses on predicting the subjective aspects of question-and-answer pairs, with an emphasis on equitable visibility of valuable responses in online question-answering platforms.

## Publication
This work is currently in press and is presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Engineering 2023. The findings will be published in the Elsevier - Procedia Computer Science Journal.

## Problem Statement
Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is crucial for applications like chatbots and sentiment analysis. The proposed solution aims to bridge the gap between human comprehension and machine analysis, particularly in the context of evaluating question-answer quality.

## Dataset
The Google Quest Q&A Labelling Dataset has been utilized in this project to construct a predictive model using Graph Neural Networks (GNN). The dataset incorporates nuanced subjective labels, providing a comprehensive evaluation of question-answer pairs.

## Methodology
- Utilizes SAGEConv Graph Neural Network with SAGEConv operator for feature extraction.
- Comprehensive evaluation of question-answer quality by incorporating nuanced subjective labels from the Google Quest dataset.

## Advantages of GNNs
